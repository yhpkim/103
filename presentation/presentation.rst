Spinnaker Metaphor
========================

.. image:: images/waterworld.jpg 
    :height: 600px
    :width: 400px

.. note::
  * A spinnaker is a parachute used in sailing which catches the wind and allows a sail boat to travel faster. 
    This is the metaphor for Spinnaker the CD tool. It is an extra sail that allows your cloud deployments to go 
    faster. There is a famous spinnaker scene in the awesomely terrible waterworld movie where the protagonist
    shoots a spinnaker out of his boat to escape the smokers.

    he ever experienced was in the army. Where they TELL you what they are going to teach you, TEACH it, and the
    TEST you on it. 
    In addition, the class is meant to be interactive and conversational. Similar to the socratic method.

.. note::
    * This presentation was created through the principles of continuous improvement. What made it possible?
      This presentation is a software project. Changes made to this presenation are pushed to GitHub, which
      then kicks off a docker build, which subsequently kicks off a pipeline in Spinnaker. This mimics the process
      at netflix and other big companies where they make hundreds if not thousands of deployments a day.

.. note::
    * The third way of DevOps is "continued experimentation" in order to learn from mistakes and achieve mastery. 
        This is the goal of DevOps mastery. Mastery of the people, processes and tools in your environment. 
        Mastery is only possible through experimentation and trying new things.

.. note::
    * Hovercraft is a python based presentation tool we use to craft our presentations. It relies on restructured text
        documents that are rendered into an HTML presetnation. We manage our presentation proejects with software development
        tools such as GitHub and Spinnaker, because our presentations are software. Managing it in this way allows us to use
        continuous experimentation, continuous improvement and continuous delivery.

5 Core Kubernetes Essential Concepts
====================================

* Pod 
* Deployment
* Service
* Ingress
* Namespace

.. note::
    * Five introductory kubernetes concepts. 

----

:id: pod

Pod
===

* The basic deployable unit in Kubernetes
* 1+ (but tends to be just one) co-located and co-scheduled containers
* All containers in a pod share network and storage
* Can communicate over **localhost**
* Represents a single instance of an application
* Think of a pod as a **logical host** for an applciation's components

.. note::
    * Overview of a pod.

----

:id: deployment

Deployment
==========

* Allows you to manage pods in a declarative and upgradeable mannaer
* Note the "replicas" field that allows for scaling the number of pods
* Provide the ability to rollout changes and roll them back if necessary
* Different deployment strategies can be used

.. note::
    * Overview of a pod. 

----

:id: service

Service
=======

* Exposes one or many Pods via an internal IP address
* Also accessbile via cluster naming

    **{service}.{namespace}.svc.cluster.local**

    **nginx.webservice.svc.cluster.local**
* Service selects pods based on labels (in this case app=nginx)
* A Service mayb expose multiple ports

.. note::
    * Overview of a service. 

----

:id: ingress

Ingress
=======

* A Service is only accessible inside of the cluster
* An Ingress controller is used to expose a Service to the external world 
* Ingress maps hostnames and paths to internal services (think reverse proxy)
* The Ingress contoller is a loadbalancer that is forward requests based on rules

.. note::
    * Overview of Ingress. 

----

:id: namespace

Namespace
=========

* A Namespace is a logical isolation method
* Group logically similar workloads in a single namespace and enforce policies. For instance you can have one namespace per team
* Role Based Access Control (RBAC) can be used to control what users can do within a namespace
* You can limit the amount of cluster resources a namespace can use

.. note::
    * Overview of a namespace. 

----

:id: K8s

Exercise 2 - K8s
================

.. raw:: html

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mcgonagle/1a1ea84eb2422ec5e119baabaee707ad.js"></script>

.. note::
    * You have built and shipped the 103 container in the previous exercise, now it is time to deploy it into your k8s single node cluster running inside
        the docker for desktop app. The above imperative commands push and then expose the 103 service to the local host making the container available 
        to the end user through kubernetes.

:id: why-spinnaker

Why Spinnaker was created
=========================

* A brief history of Deployments at Netflix

* A need for end to end orchestration

*  When deploying to the cloud, your development platform should understand the cloud

.. note::
    * Asgard created an intuitive model for EC2 cloud-based applications that has made deployment and ongoing management of AWS resources easy. Everything required to produce a deployment artifact, in this case an AMI, has never been addressed in Asgard. Spinnaker, kicked off to enable end-to-end global Continuous Delivery at Netflix.
    * What Asgard didn’t have
    * This is why Spinnaker was built
    * The goals of this project were to create a Continuous Delivery platform that would:
        * enable repeatable automated deployments captured as flexible pipelines and configurable pipeline stages
        * provide a global view across all the environments that an application passes through in its deployment pipeline
        * offer programmatic configuration and execution via a consistent and reliable API
        * be easy to configure, maintain, and extend
        * be operationally resilient
        * provide the existing benefits of Asgard without a migration
 

----

:id: spinnaker-philosophy

Spinnaker Philosophy
====================

* Make all of your infrastructure immutable
* Make the deployment tool aware of infrastructure
* Minimize the possibility of errors in deployments
* Make deployments easy and repeatable
* When deployments fail, make it easy to roll back 
* Make it possible to deploy where you want, when you want 

.. note::
    * Immutable means there’s no chance of a failed config change
        * Changes are tested before they are deployed
        * You will always know the state of all your applications
    * Your platform should be smart enough to know what is going on with your infra at all times; no fire and forget
    * By automating the stages of your SDLC and defining them in a common tool deployments are always  done the way you intended
    * Related to last point, it should be easy to use.  For everyone.  You shouldn’t need special AWS, GCP, K8s knowledge to deploy.  You should be able to deploy.
    * Deployments sometimes go wrong. Spinnaker will catch it the problem is with the cloud, but when a bug slips through in the app being deployed it should take just a click to rollback
    * Spinnaker is always on, always ready to deploy. Your company may not be ready for 1,000 deployments a day and that’s OK, there are tools in Spinnaker to put up guard rails until you are ready a thousand, or even two thousand deployments a day.  You can get there!

:id: stages-overview

Stages Overview
===============

Stages are automated steps of your SDLC
    - Software builds in your CI tool
    - Automated tests
    - Manual tests or judgments
    - Deployments
    - Scaling activities
    - Baking (creating) a new image
    - Evaulations
    - Wait stage
    - Much more...


.. note::
    * This is a talk slide, explain SOME of the possible stages, but not all (there’s too many options).
    * Stage is a logical orchestrated step in a pipeline, it does one thing.
    * That one thing can be comprised of multiple actions, in other words small tasks.
    * Touch on the differences in things like Deploy stage (aws vs k8s)

Baking Manifests
================

.. image:: images/helm/baking_manifest.png
    :height: 450px
    :width: 1080px
    :align: center

.. note::
    * Spinnaker surfaces a "Bake (Manifest)" stage to turn templates into manifests with the help of a templating engine. 
    * The baked manifest is then deployed as an artifact to the Deploy(Manifest) stage and is pushed to the K8s cluster. 
    * This stage is intended to help you package and deploy applications that you own, and are actively developing and redploying frequently.
    * It is not intended to serve as a one-time installation method for third-party packages. If that is your goal, it's arguably 
      better to call *helm install* once when bootstrapping your kubernetes cluster.

Spring Expression Language(SpEL) Introduction
=============================================

.. note::
    * Transition Slide for SpEL

----

:id: about-spel

About SpEL
==========

Add logic to pipelines

Used mostly to eval variables

    * Set vars from build systems
    * Pass image names between stages
    * Retrieve and eval manual judge responses

Can do much more

    * Embed java/groovy

.. note::
    * The expression language is a powerful tool that you can use to add logic and decision-making to your pipelines. While a lot of the time you will probably use it to evaluate variables, it can do a lot more. You can write straight Java/Groovy into it. This means you can do transformations, filters, maps, etc. You can use it to branch your pipeline into different directions.
    * Some of the most common uses include 
        * Getting build information from Jenkins
        * Passing image names from one stage to another
        * Retrieving a user's manual judgment responses


----

:id: spring-expressions

Spring Expressions
==================

What does a Spring Expression look like?

    * A shell variable

Where can I use them?

    * Any place in the UI where you can enter free-form text
    * In the "Edit Pipeline JSON" tool

When are they evaulated?

    * At stage execution time

Any exceptions?

    * Yes, can't use during pipeline configuration stage

Expression Tools - Helper Functions
===================================

.. image:: images/expression_tool.png
    :height: 450px
    :width: 1080px
    :align: center

.. note::
    * Builtin helper functions to simplify some common use cases
    * These functions allow you to do things like access a particular stage by name, strip non-alphanumerical characters out of a string or parse JSON
    * Adding a pound sign (#) within your pipeline expression displays a list of tall of the helper functions that are available


----

:id: expression-tool-helper

Expression Tools - Helper Properties
====================================

.. image:: images/expression_tool_helper.png
    :height: 450px
    :width: 1080px
    :align: center


.. note::
    * Helper properties are variables which refer to global information about the curren pipeline execution
    * Example if you've set up a Jenkins trigger and want to know which build triggered the curren pipeline, you could access that information with the expression ${trigger["buildInfo"]["number"]}
    * quickly list available helper properties and stages you can enter a question mark into your pipeline expression.

----

:id: expression-tools-context-values

Expression Tools - Context Values
=================================

* Context values are similar to helper properties, except that they are specific to a particular stage
* Includes the stage name, status, start or end time and so on
* Use context values in combination with the #stage helper function to access properties fo a particular stage

* example, ${#stage("Deploy to Prod")["type"]} returns the stage type

.. note::
    *  Great for passing info betwen stages

----

:id: expression-tools-property-files

Expression Tools - Property Files
=================================
* A *property file* is a file containing a list of variables that you would liek to pass to your pipeline
* Can be a Java .properties file, YML, or JSON

.. note::
    * Spinnaker reads the contents of this file and adds this specified variables to the pipeline context

----

:id: expression-tools-special-characters

Expression Tools - Special Characters
=====================================

* Use pipeline expressions to set a default value for a field with the characters ?:
* Example, ${parameters["region"] ?: 'us-east-1'} sets the region to us-east-1 unless otherwise spcified. 

* You can filter maps using .?
* Example, return a list of all of the bake stages in your pipeline, use the expression ${execution["stages"].?[type == "bake"]}

.. note::
    * note

----

:id: expression-tools-debug-more

Expression Tools - Debug & More
===============================

* Can debug SPeL issues by viewing the source tab in the failed pipeline's execution history
* Able to access whitelisted java classes (see link below)
